DES Encryption Module
C++

To run program, find executable in /x64/Release/DES_Encryption_Module.exe

Developed in Visual Studio 2022

The main source files are DES_Encryption_Module.cpp and DES_Key_Module.cpp

Development is ongoing. As os 1/28/2024, I have only implemented DES through the initial permutation and first permutation half-split.
